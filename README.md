## ⚡️ Used in Real Apps

ExpoPlus is already powering real-world projects built with React Native and Expo:

| App | Description |
|-----|--------------|
| **App1** | A mobile invoicing and payment management tool using Expo Router, Zustand, and Firebase — built entirely with ExpoPlus for instant iteration. |
| **App2** | A social and analytics app featuring camera, sharing, and notifications — all running out-of-the-box with ExpoPlus. |

> 🧠 These implementations show ExpoPlus can handle Firebase, navigation, ads, and animations without rebuild friction.
